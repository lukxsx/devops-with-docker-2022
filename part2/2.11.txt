I tried to start using Docker on my website project which is made with the Flask
framework for Python. I used the python:3.9-alpine image. The image will run the
application using the Gunicorn server, but it can be easily modified to use
the internal Flask development server.

I had some problems with the python dependencies. First psycopg2 complained while
building because the image didn't have PostgreSQL insalled. I fixed this by using
the psycopg2-binary package.

The python package Pillow caused the most problems. It's installation from pip
failed every time, because it needs some development packages to compile. 
By reading Stackoverflow, I found a way. I modified the Docker file so that the
required dev packages are installed first from Alpine repos. Pillow is then
installed with a pip, and after that the dev packages are removed.

I added a sed command to edit the Pillow out from the requirements.txt, because
pip would try to install it again (and fail). Not the app is working, but there
were still some errors caused by the pillow package. Some image-editing libraries
that it needs seem to be missing from the image. I need to investigate that.

So far the docker works for development, but I still need to improve few things
in order to use it for running the application.
