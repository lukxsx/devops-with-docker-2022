# 3.7
I used my 2048 game from tiralabra course, https://github.com/lukxsx/2048-ai

## Before
```
FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y build-essential
WORKDIR /build
COPY . .
RUN make -j$(nproc)

ENTRYPOINT ["/build/2048"]
```
Size: 374MB

## After
```
FROM alpine:latest as builder

WORKDIR /build
COPY . .

RUN adduser -u 1000 -D appuser && \
  apk --no-cache add build-base bash && \
  make -j$(nproc) CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -static"

FROM scratch
COPY --from=builder /build/2048 /2048
COPY --from=builder /etc/passwd /etc/passwd
USER appuser

ENTRYPOINT ["/2048"]
```
Size: 283kB

I changed to alpine build with regular user account.
Using scratch with a static binary really brings down the size.
